# About
This application was built in the purpose of helping the Greater Delta executive team manage execution of team priorities.
In production, this application will be run via google apps script and employ a google sheet as a back-end. The apps-script will generate the appropriate JSON for all non-map related features. 
The map is updated periodically from a variety of data sources converted to CSVs. It is statically updated with HTML generated with a python script _bpviz.py_ as needed.
